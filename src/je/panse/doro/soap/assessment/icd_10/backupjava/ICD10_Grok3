Assumed Structure and Modifications
Based on our previous conversation, I assume your five classes might include:

DatabaseManager: Handles SQLite3 connections and CRUD operations.
MainFrame: The main Swing window (e.g., ICD10EditorFrame).
InputPanel: A panel for user input (e.g., text fields for ICD-10 code, disease, description).
ButtonPanel: A panel with action buttons (e.g., Add, Update, Delete).
FileImporter: A class like ICD10FileImporter for importing data from files.
